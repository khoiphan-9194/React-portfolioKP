# React Portfolio

## Description
    
A portfolio made using React. This portfolio serves as a place to share my projects for the perusal of both potential employers and fellow developers.

A portfolio is a convenient location to summarize your work experience and history, as well as to share information about yourself that employers might find useful to know. The portfolio is meant to have a clear layout and navigation bar to make it easy for employers to view an individual's personal information, professional work examples, and contact information. This portfolio is made using React.js, a front-end JavaScript library used by many web developers today.

Creating this new portfolio with updated technologies helped me become more familiar with using React to create web components. I was also able to get more practice writing in .jsx files. Finally, I was able to try a new layout and desgin compared to my previous portfolio.
